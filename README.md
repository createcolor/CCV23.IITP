## Course scoring:

Since schedule of this course was unstable, score will be calculated accorging to wollowing rules

$Score = 0.8 \times Exam + 0.2 \times Presense + 0.5 \times Practice$,

$Exam$ - is calculated after oral converstion about two topics from the list;   
$Presense$ - is a percent of lectures you have visited;   
$Practice$ - is a score for your solution on pipeline reverse engineering.   

## Homework

This year, the reverse engineering of the Canon 600D camera will be a homework assignment. 
To do this, download the [Cube++ dataset](https://zendo.org/records/4153431) and create an algorithm reproducing the pipeline of image processing of the Canon 600D camera. 
Your solution will be tested on new images from the Canon 600D camera.
